### DATE:09/04/2024                                                                            
### REGISTER NUMBER:212221220026 
### AIM: 
To  write  a logic program  to solve Towers of Hanoi problem  using SWI-PROLOG. 
### ALGORITHM:
1. Start the program
2. Write a rules for finding solution of Towers of Hanoi in SWI-PROLOG.
3.  a )	If only one disk  => Move disk from X to Y.
4.  b)	If Number of disk greater than 0 then
5. Move  N-1 disks from X to Z.
6. Move  Nth disk from X to Y
7. Move  N-1 disks from Y to X.
8. Run the program  to find answer of  query.
### PROGRAM:
```
move(1,X,Y,_) :- 
 write('Move top disk from '), 
 write(X), 
 write(' to '), 
 write(Y), 
 nl. 
move(N,X,Y,Z) :- 
 N>1, 
 M is N-1, 
 move(M,X,Z,Y), 
 move(1,X,Y,_), 
 move(M,Z,Y,X).
```
### OUTPUT:

### RESULT:
Thus the solution of Towers of Hanoi problem was found by logic programming.
